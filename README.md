Welcome to the initiative tracker app (name TBD). This project is still a dream rather than a bit of software, but I'm working on it a bit at a time!

The hope for this project is to create a DM tool that effectively and efficiently lets a dungeon master build and execute encounters. 
Some of the planned features include:
  * Inputting custom player and creature data
  * Building parties of PCs for easy entry into an encounter
  * Creating and storing custom homebrew creatures, species, classes, and creature types
  * Tracking initiative, concentration, and conditions for an entire encounter
  * Being able to view HP, AC, and other common stats at a glance
