# Welcome to the Combat Companion (name TBD). This project is still a dream rather than a bit of software, but I'm working on it a bit at a time

The hope for this project is to create a DM tool that effectively and efficiently lets a dungeon master build and execute encounters.
Some of the planned features include:

* Inputting custom player and creature data
* Building parties of PCs for easy entry into an encounter
* Creating and storing custom homebrew creatures, species, classes, and creature types
* Tracking initiative, concentration, and conditions for an entire encounter
* Being able to view HP, AC, and other common stats at a glance
